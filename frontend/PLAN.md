# Plomp Timeline Viewer Implementation Plan

## Overview
Create an information-dense, debugging-focused timeline viewer that displays buffer items in a vertical descending timeline with playback controls, detailed inspection capabilities, and filtering options.

## Component Architecture

### Layout Components
1. **App (Root)** - Main container and state management ✅
2. **Header** - Contains filters and global controls ✅
3. **TimelineView** - Primary timeline display ✅
4. **DetailSidebar** - Shows details for selected items ✅
5. **PlaybackControls** - Timeline navigation controls ✅

### Core Components
1. **TimelineItem** - Represents individual buffer items ✅
   - Visual differentiation based on type (event, query, prompt)
   - Compact display of essential information
   - Interactive selection capability
   
2. **FilterBar** - Tag-based filtering interface ✅
   - Filter by type (event, query, prompt)
   - Filter by specific tags (event_type, model, importance)
   - Custom filter creation
   
3. **PlaybackController** - Stepping and playback functionality ✅
   - Play/pause timeline playback
   - Step forward/backward
   - Jump to specific points
   - Speed control (to be implemented)
   
4. **DetailView** - Expandable/collapsible detailed information ✅
   - JSON tree view for item data
   - Context-specific visualizations (to be implemented)
   - Copy functionality for debugging (to be implemented)

## State Management
- Timeline data with filtering capabilities ✅
- Current selection state ✅
- Playback state (playing, paused, speed) ✅
- Filter configuration ✅

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Core Timeline View ✅
1. Set up basic app structure ✅
2. Implement vertical timeline component ✅
3. Display items with minimal information ✅
4. Add selection capability ✅

### Phase 2: Detailed View and Interactions (In Progress)
1. Build detail sidebar ✅
2. Connect selection to detail view ✅
3. Implement expandable tree view for data inspection (To do)
4. Add interaction capabilities (highlight, copy) (To do)

### Phase 3: Filtering and Search (In Progress)
1. Create filter interface ✅
2. Implement filtering logic ✅
3. Add search capabilities (To do)
4. Optimize performance for large datasets (To do)

### Phase 4: Playback Controls (In Progress)
1. Implement stepping functionality ✅
2. Add playback controls ✅
3. Create timestamp display and navigation (To do)
4. Add playback speed controls (To do)

## UI/UX Considerations
- Information density vs. clarity balance
- Consistent color coding for different item types ✅
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users (To do)
- Responsive design for different screen sizes (To do)
- Dark mode for reduced eye strain during debugging (To do)

## Technical Considerations
- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Efficient filtering and searching
- Time-based navigation
- State persistence for debugging sessions
